# My weird rules for my internet shopping addiction

- If it's a necessity (like toilet paper or almond milk) just buy it.
- If it's a new gadget, it will make your much life easier (NOT HARDER - like no new projects or perfecting existing ones) and it's <$20, just get it
- Each task is either:
    - Tiny - $0: Takes very little time to do, and doesn’t require leaving the house, or it’s fun.
    - Small - $25-$75: It can be fun but hard or just really annoying to do or something that I've been procrastinating on for a while. 
    - Large - $100-$200: A bigger task that's a big accomplishment (like completing Demo December or performing at Open Decks or having a "perfect" time management week)
- Tiny tasks don’t get a reward
- If it's urgent add it to your phone list
- All tasks on paper must be completed before tallying the different types of tasks.
- If the task is too big, then break it down and make the starting task the thing on the list instead.
- If I write something down, and I don’t think I should really prioritize it anymore, you at least have to do one task with it, and move the big item to the next open card
- If you accomplish something but didn't write it down write it on the latest open card! Then I get points for it when the card is done!
- A GIFT IS A GIFT!

## Struggling with this stuff

Struggling with shopping, because like if I go out shopping, I don’t do that very often and I want to take advantage….
