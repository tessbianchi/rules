# My weird Rules for my internet shopping addiction

- If something is continuing an existing project and is under $20, just buy it
- Every small task is worth $75 
-  Each task is either:
    - Tiny: takes very little time to do, and doesn’t require leaving the house, or it’s fun
    - Small: It can be fun, but hard or just really annoying to do
    - Medium: Either 5 small tasks or completing some larger (but not sooo large) goal. (i.e. playing at Open Decks)
    - Large: Either 25 small tasks or complete some large goal (that’s kinda out of your control)
    - Small, Medium, Large tasks correspond to <125, 125-250, >250
- Tiny tasks don’t get a reward
- All tasks on paper must be completed before tallying the different types of tasks.
- If the task is too big, then break it down and make the starting task the thing on the list instead.
- If I write something down, and I don’t think I should really prioritize it anymore, you at least have to do one task with it, and move the big item to the next open card
- If you accomplish something but didn't write it down write it on the latest open card! Then I get points for it when the card is done!
- A GIFT IS A GIFT!

## Struggling with this stuff

Struggling with shopping, because like if I go out shopping, I don’t do that very often and I want to take advantage….
